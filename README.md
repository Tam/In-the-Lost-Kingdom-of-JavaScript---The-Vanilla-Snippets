# In the Lost Kingdom of JavaScript - The Vanilla Snippets
A useful collection of JavaScript snippets

### [Fuzzy](https://github.com/Tam/LostKingdom/blob/master/fuzzy.js)
A tiny and blazing-fast fuzzy search in JavaScript (stolen *(but modified)* from [@bevacqua](https://github.com/bevacqua/fuzzysearch))

### [Create Element](https://github.com/Tam/LostKingdom/blob/master/createElement.js)
Quick and easy DOM element creation

### [Debounce](https://github.com/Tam/LostKingdom/blob/master/debounce.js)
A function, that, as long as it continues to be invoked, will not be triggered (good for preventing spam from `input` events). (Supports React)

### [IntervalTimer](https://github.com/Tam/LostKingdom/blob/master/IntervalTimer.js)
A pause-able interval timer, great for looping banners that you want to pause on hover. Once un-paused, it will wait out the amount of time it would have had to wait if not paused, before continuing.
